Each instance of a fade in slideshow on the page is completely independent of the other, with support for different features selectively enabled for each slide show (This is the updated version of superb slide-show plug-in). This plugin lets showcase your images with corresponding description. this is a ultimate fade in slideshow gallery.

*   Each slide can be optionally hyper linked.
*   Each slide can have an optional description associated with it. 
*   Descriptions can either be set to show on demand (when the mouse rolls over the slide), or be always visible until explicitly dismissed.
*   Slide-show automatically pauses onMouseover.

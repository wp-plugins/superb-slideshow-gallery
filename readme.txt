This is a strong, cross browser fade in slideshow script that incorporates some of your most requested features all rolled into one. Each instance of a fade in slideshow on the page is completely independent of the other, with support for different features selectively enabled for each slide show(This is the updated version of superb slide-show plug-in).

*   Superb fade in effect that has the current image fading over the previous one.
*   Slide-show can be set to stop rotating after x cycles.
*   Each slide can be optionally hyper linked.
*   Each slide can have an optional description associated with it. Descriptions can either be set to show on demand (when the mouse rolls over the slide), or be always visible until explicitly dismissed.
*   Slide-show automatically pauses onMouseover.

We can configure this plug-in in three different way.

**1. Drag and drop the widget!**

Go to widget menu and drag and drop the “superb slideshow gallery” widget to your sidebar location. <br />

**2. Copy and past the mentioned code to your desired template location.**

**3. Use below code in post or page.**
